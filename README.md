## Hola, I'm Duane

I have a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia in rainy Vancouver, BC. I've been developing software since I was 16 years old,
and thankfully continue to do so now.  Github contains a small ensemble of code that I've worked on over the years.
